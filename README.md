# Drowsiness-Detection-System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System project is developed to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue. It is designed to monitor the driver's facial features in real time, detecting signs of drowsiness such as blinking and yawning. Using OpenCV and Dlibâ€™s 68-point facial landmark detector, the system identifies the driver's eyes and mouth and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to evaluate alertness. If signs of fatigue are detected, a text-to-speech alarm is triggered to wake the driver. The project uses a face detection technique based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Achieving eye detection accuracy of 80.17% and drowsiness detection accuracy of 78.50%, the system performs best under well-lit conditions. Future enhancements may include tracking head posture to improve detection accuracy on real roads.
